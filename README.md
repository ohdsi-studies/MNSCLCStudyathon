This study seeks to evaluate the real-world treatment landscape of mNSCLC patients across a global network of observational healthcare data sources, with a particular focus on the introduction and impact of ICIs. Key objectives include:
* Characterizing demographics and clinical characteristics of mNSCLC patients.
* Describing treatment pathways and clinical outcomes, including time to treatment discontinuation, time to next line of treatment and overall survival.
* Investigating geographic and temporal trends in ICI uptake and the resulting shifts in treatment outcomes.
